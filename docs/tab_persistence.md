# Tab Persistence Feature Documentation

## Overview

This document explains the implementation of the tab persistence feature in the RAGU application. This feature allows the application to remember which tab (Chat or Files) was active when the page is refreshed, providing a better user experience by maintaining the user's context across page reloads.

## Implementation Details

### Changes Made

The tab persistence feature was implemented by modifying the JavaScript code in the `index.html` file. The key changes include:

1. Created a new `setActiveTab` function that:
   - Saves the active tab name to `localStorage`
   - Updates the UI to show the selected tab

2. Updated the click event handlers for both tabs to use the new `setActiveTab` function

3. Added code that runs when the page loads to:
   - Check `localStorage` for a saved tab preference
   - Set the appropriate tab as active based on the stored preference
   - Default to the chat tab if no preference is found

### Code Explanation

```javascript
// Function to set active tab
function setActiveTab(tabName) {
    // Save active tab to localStorage
    localStorage.setItem('activeTab', tabName);
    
    if (tabName === 'chat') {
        chatMenuItem.classList.add('active');
        filesMenuItem.classList.remove('active');
        chatInterface.classList.add('active');
        fileManagement.classList.remove('active');
    } else if (tabName === 'files') {
        filesMenuItem.classList.add('active');
        chatMenuItem.classList.remove('active');
        fileManagement.classList.add('active');
        chatInterface.classList.remove('active');
    }
}

// Chat menu item click handler
chatMenuItem.addEventListener('click', function() {
    setActiveTab('chat');
});

// Files menu item click handler
filesMenuItem.addEventListener('click', function() {
    setActiveTab('files');
});

// Check localStorage for active tab on page load
const activeTab = localStorage.getItem('activeTab');
if (activeTab === 'files') {
    setActiveTab('files');
} else {
    // Default to chat tab if no saved preference or 'chat' is saved
    setActiveTab('chat');
}
```

## How It Works

1. **Storing Tab Preference**:
   - When a user clicks on either the Chat or Files tab, the `setActiveTab` function is called
   - This function stores the tab name ('chat' or 'files') in the browser's `localStorage` using the key 'activeTab'
   - The function also updates the UI to show the selected tab as active

2. **Restoring Tab Preference**:
   - When the page loads, the code checks `localStorage` for a saved tab preference
   - If a preference is found and it's 'files', the Files tab is set as active
   - If no preference is found or the saved preference is 'chat', the Chat tab is set as active (default behavior)

3. **User Experience**:
   - Users can navigate between tabs as usual
   - When they refresh the page, the application will remember which tab they were viewing
   - This maintains the user's context and provides a more seamless experience

## Testing

To test the tab persistence feature:

1. Open the application in a browser
2. Click on the Files tab
3. Refresh the page
4. Verify that the Files tab remains selected
5. Click on the Chat tab
6. Refresh the page
7. Verify that the Chat tab remains selected

A mock test script (`test_tab_persistence.js`) has also been created to verify the logic of the implementation.

## Browser Compatibility

This implementation uses the `localStorage` API, which is supported by all modern browsers. The feature should work consistently across different browsers and devices.

## Limitations

- `localStorage` is domain-specific, so the tab preference will only be remembered when accessing the application from the same domain
- If a user clears their browser data or uses private/incognito mode, the tab preference will not be remembered
- `localStorage` has a storage limit (typically 5-10MB), but this feature uses a negligible amount of storage
